# Stack Facts (Reusable)

Keep this file project-agnostic. Project-specific paths belong in `project-profile.md`.

- Typical backend stack: NestJS + TypeORM + GraphQL + Jest
- Typical admin stack: React + TypeScript + build tool (Vite/Next/etc)
- Typical mobile stack: React Native + TypeScript + Jest
- CI gates should enforce: tests, contract invariants, release smoke checks
