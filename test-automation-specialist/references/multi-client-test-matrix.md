# Multi-Client Test Matrix

## Backend
- unit/integration for changed domains
- contract snapshot for immutable queries

## Admin
- layout + interaction constraints
- regression for existing operations

## Mobile user app (`recl-rn`)
- immutable query contract checks
- pickup day availability behavior checks

## Mobile rider app (`recl-rider-rn`)
- pickup detail/list contract checks
- assignment/schedule-related semantic checks

Gate is PASS only when all required client matrices are green.
