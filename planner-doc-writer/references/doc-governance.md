# Doc Governance

## Rules
- Keep one master overview and linked task docs.
- Every task doc must include DoD and rollback policy.
- Update links when task files are renamed or split.
- Do not duplicate policy text if a source doc already owns it.

## Review checklist
- Sequencing explicit
- Dependencies explicit
- Acceptance criteria testable
- Risks and assumptions explicit
